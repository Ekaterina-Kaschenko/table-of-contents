# Table of Contents Component (JetBrains Test Task)

This project contains the **client-side implementation** of a **Table of Contents** component, built as part of a test task for JetBrains.  
The component is designed for flexibility, performance, and maintainability, following modern React development best practices.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Dynamic Table of Contents rendering** based on structured data (`pages`, `anchors`, `topLevelIds`).
- **Expandable / collapsible topics** with smooth transitions.
- **Highlighting rules** based on nesting level (first level always highlighted, current topic highlighted).
- **Anchor display** only after the related page is activated.
- **Performance-optimized** removed `useCallback` and `useMemo` usage to take full advantage of the new React Compiler in the TreeView component.
- Integrated with ESLint (including eslint-plugin-react-hooks@rc) for compiler-aware linting..

## ðŸ“¦ Tech Stack

- **React** (with new compiler optimizations)
- **TypeScript**
- **Jest** + **React Testing Library** for unit tests
- **ESLint** for linting and code quality
- **Vite** for fast development build
