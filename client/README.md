# Table of Contents Component (JetBrains Test Task)

This project contains the **client-side implementation** of a **Table of Contents** component, built as part of a test task for JetBrains.  
The component is designed for flexibility, performance, and maintainability, following modern React development best practices.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Dynamic Table of Contents rendering** based on structured data (`pages`, `anchors`, `topLevelIds`).
- **Expandable / collapsible topics** with smooth recursive rendering.
- **Highlighting rules** based on nesting level
  - First level always highlighted
  - Current topic highlighted in blue
- **Anchor display** only after the related page is activated.
- **Search functionality** with server-side filtering using DFS algorithm.
- **Deep linking** â€” search parameters are stored in the URL so results persist on reload or when sharing the link.
- **Set active topic by ID** with auto-scrolling and highlighting.
- **No Results state** with a friendly UI when no matches are found.
- **Theme switching** between light, dark, and system modes.
- **Performance-optimized** â€” removed unnecessary `useCallback` and `useMemo` usage to take full advantage of the new React Compiler in the TreeView component.
- Integrated with **ESLint** (including `eslint-plugin-react-hooks@rc`) for compiler-aware linting.
